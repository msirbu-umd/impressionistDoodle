# ImpressionistDoodle
## Running the code

1) Download the code as a zip file. <br />
2) In the folder it was saved, extract-all (I used 7zip) <br />
3) Open Android Studio <br />
4) On the quick start menu click Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.) <br />
5) Navigate to where you extracted the files, you should see impressionistDoodle-mainFocus (with the android studio symbol) <br />
in that location
6) Click on impressionistDoodle-mainFocus and click ok <br />
7) The project should be loaded in. <br />

NOTE: To be able to run the additional feature, you must have a device that allows for camera access.
